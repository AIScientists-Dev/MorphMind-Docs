# Data & Privacy

Questions about security, compliance, and data handling.

---

## Is my data secure?

Yes. MorphMind takes data security seriously:

- **Encryption at rest** — AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Encryption in transit** — TLS 1.3 for all data transmission
- **Access controls** — Role-based permissions and audit logging

---

## Can I keep my data private?

Yes. Your agents, knowledge, and outputs are private by default. You control what you share and with whom.

---

## Do you train on my data?

No. Your data is used only to power your agents. We do not use customer data to train our models.

## Where is my data stored?

Data is stored in secure cloud infrastructure with encryption at rest. Enterprise customers can specify data residency requirements.

---

## Can I delete my data?

Yes. You can delete agents, files, and account data at any time through your settings. For complete account deletion, contact support at [support@morphmind.ai](mailto:support@morphmind.ai).

## Who has access to my data?

Only you and users you explicitly share with. MorphMind staff do not access customer data except when required for support (with your permission) or legal compliance.
