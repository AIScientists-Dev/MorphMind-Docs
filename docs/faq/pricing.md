## Understanding Credits

Every interaction with a MorphMind agent consumes credits. Think of credits as a unified measure of the compute behind your agent — covering reasoning, execution, and data access in a single number.

### What consumes credits?

Three things drive credit usage:

- **AI reasoning** — when your agent plans steps, writes code, analyzes results, or generates reports. Deeper reasoning and longer conversations naturally use more.
- **Compute** — when your agent runs Python code, processes data files, or generates visualizations in its cloud environment.
- **External data access** — when your agent queries databases, searches the web, or calls third-party APIs on your behalf.

Only active work costs credits. Finished agents, saved outputs, and stored files sit at zero cost — nothing ticks in the background.

If a task fails due to a platform issue, we refund the credits automatically. We're also continuously improving efficiency so the same work costs fewer credits over time.

### Real usage examples

Based on actual platform usage across hundreds of sessions.

---

#### Light — Quick question or lookup

> *"Analyze AAPL stock — give me price, fundamentals, and recent news"*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Complexity** | Light |
| **What happens** | Agent retrieves data, summarizes findings |
| **Duration** | ~4 minutes |
| **Credits used** | **~100** |

---

#### Medium — Build an agent and run a focused analysis

> *"Assess BRAF as a cancer drug target — search genetics, clinical evidence, and competitive landscape"*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **What happens** | Multi-step pipeline: database queries, literature search, report generation |
| **Duration** | ~15 minutes |
| **Credits used** | **~500** |

---

#### Heavy — Deep research with code execution and iteration

> *"Build a single-cell RNA-seq pipeline, validate on PBMC 3k, then annotate cell types and run trajectory analysis"*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Complexity** | Heavy |
| **What happens** | Agent writes and runs Python code, iterates on parameters, produces multiple figures |
| **Duration** | ~30 minutes |
| **Credits used** | **~1,000** |

### How far do credits go?

| Plan | Monthly Credits | Approximate Usage |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Essential** (5,000) | ~50 light tasks, or ~10 medium analyses, or ~5 heavy research sessions |
| **Pro** (10,000) | ~100 light tasks, or ~20 medium analyses, or ~10 heavy research sessions |
| **Max** (30,000) | ~300 light tasks, or ~60 medium analyses, or ~30 heavy research sessions |

Most users mix task types. A typical Pro user might run 10–15 medium analyses and 30–40 quick questions in a month.

### Do credits roll over?

- **Monthly credits** refresh on your billing date. Unused credits from the previous month do not carry over.
- **Add-on credits** (purchased separately) have no expiration — use them whenever you need them.
