# Biomedical Research Agents

Agents designed for biology and medicine research workflows, from literature review through data analysis to clinical interpretation.

**Intended users:** Academic researchers, translational scientists, computational biologists

## Available Agents

### Literature Search and Reasoning Copilot

Searches, compares, and synthesizes scientific literature.

**Capabilities:**
- Search across scientific databases
- Compare findings across multiple papers
- Synthesize insights from large bodies of literature
- Generate annotated summaries with citations

**Typical uses:** Literature reviews, project initiation, staying current in a field

---

### scRNA-seq Copilot

Supports single-cell RNA-seq analysis and interpretation.

**Capabilities:**
- Process raw single-cell data
- Perform quality control and normalization
- Identify cell clusters and markers
- Generate visualizations
- Interpret results in biological context

**Typical uses:** Cell type identification, differential expression analysis, single-cell workflows

---

### Spatial Transcriptomics Copilot

Analyzes tissue architecture and spatial gene expression patterns.

**Capabilities:**
- Map gene expression to spatial coordinates
- Identify spatial patterns and domains
- Analyze cell-cell interactions in tissue context
- Integrate with histology images

**Typical uses:** Tissue organization analysis, tumor microenvironment studies

---

### Multi-omics Copilot

Integrates data from multiple omics modalities.

**Capabilities:**
- Harmonize data across different omics layers
- Identify cross-modal patterns
- Generate integrated visualizations
- Support multi-modal cell atlases

**Typical uses:** CITE-seq analysis, Multiome integration, comprehensive cellular profiling

---

### Clinical Translation Agent

Connects molecular findings to clinical relevance.

**Capabilities:**
- Link basic research to clinical applications
- Identify druggable targets
- Map findings to disease pathways
- Assess therapeutic potential

**Typical uses:** Translational research, target identification, clinical relevance assessment

## Workflow Example

**Scenario:** Analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data from tumor samples to understand the immune microenvironment.

1. Use **scRNA-seq Copilot** to process and cluster data
2. Use **Literature Search Copilot** to identify relevant marker genes
3. Use **Clinical Translation Agent** to map findings to immunotherapy predictors
4. Export figures and reports

Agents retain context from previous sessions, allowing workflows to build on prior work.
