**Outcome:** Reduced onboarding time; knowledge persists when members leave.

### Course Administration

**Challenge:** Large courses require consistent grading across multiple TAs.

**Approach:** Configure a Grading Agent with rubrics and examples. TAs use the agent to ensure consistency.

**Outcome:** More uniform grading; reduced calibration meetings.
