# What Can AI Agents Do?

AI agents go far beyond simple chat. Here's what makes them genuinely useful for real work.

## Work With You Step-by-Step

AI agents support interactive workflows where you stay in control:

- **Watch progress in real time** — See each step as it happens
- **Pause whenever you want** — Stop to review before moving on
- **Change direction mid-stream** — Adjust the approach as you learn more
- **Guide the process** — Steer the agent based on your expertise

You keep oversight while the agent handles the routine work.

## Show You Everything

Each agent maintains a clear record of what it knows and how it thinks:

- **Source tracking** — See exactly where information comes from
- **Decision logic** — Understand why the agent made each choice
- **Asks, not guesses** — When something is unclear, a well-designed agent asks you rather than making something up

## Remember Across Sessions

Unlike chatbots that start fresh every time, agents can:

- **Carry forward what they learn** — The agent's knowledge grows across sessions, so you don't re-explain the same background
- **Learn your preferences over time** — The more you work together, the better it understands how you think
- **Build understanding of your projects** — Context about your ongoing work stays with the agent

## Create Real Deliverables

Agents don't just chat—they produce actual outputs:

- Figures and visualizations
- Reports and summaries
- Formatted exports ready to use

## What an Agent Actually Is (in AgentLab)

In AgentLab, an agent combines five key elements:

1. **A goal or role** — What it's responsible for
2. **Knowledge sources** — Papers, notes, project context, etc.
3. **Tools and operators** — Actions it can take (analysis, computing, workflow steps)
4. **A workflow** — Dynamic steps that adapt based on your feedback (go back, skip ahead, branch)
5. **Memory** — How it improves with feedback and repeated use

This is what makes AgentLab agents different from just using ChatGPT: they're built for human–AI co-reasoning in real research workflows.
