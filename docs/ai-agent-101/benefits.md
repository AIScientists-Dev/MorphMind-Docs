# Capabilities of AI Agents

This page describes the key capabilities that distinguish AI agents from traditional chatbots.

## Core Capabilities

### Step-by-Step Collaboration

AI agents support interactive workflows where users can:

- **Monitor progress** — View each step as it executes
- **Pause execution** — Stop at any point to review
- **Modify decisions** — Adjust the agent's approach mid-workflow
- **Guide direction** — Steer the process in real time

This allows users to maintain oversight while delegating routine tasks.

### Transparent Reasoning

Each agent maintains a knowledge base that shows:
- Information sources the agent has access to
- Decision logic for each step
- Materials uploaded for training

**Traceability**: Outputs link back to their sources. Users can inspect the underlying logic and code for any step.

**Clarification handling**: When information is ambiguous or missing, the agent requests clarification rather than making assumptions.

### Persistent Memory

Unlike session-based chatbots, agents can:

- Retain context across multiple sessions
- Learn user preferences over time
- Build cumulative understanding of projects

### Output Generation

Agents can produce deliverables directly:

- Figures and visualizations
- Reports and summaries
- Formatted exports

### Execution Modes

Users can choose their level of involvement:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Auto-run** | Agent executes the full workflow; user reviews results |
| **Manual** | User and agent collaborate on each step |

Manual mode is useful when domain expertise is needed at decision points.

## Use Cases

### For Individual Users

- Reduce time on repetitive analysis tasks
- Focus on interpretation rather than data processing
- Work with specialized tools without coding

### For Teams and Organizations

- Capture institutional knowledge in reusable form
- Standardize workflows across team members
- Reduce onboarding time for new members

## Comparison: AI Agents vs. Chatbots

| Aspect | AI Agents | Traditional Chatbots |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Context** | Persistent across sessions | Resets each conversation |
| **Transparency** | Traceable reasoning | Limited visibility |
| **Uncertainty** | Requests clarification | May guess |
| **Workflows** | Multi-step, long-running | Single-turn responses |
| **Customization** | Domain-specific | General-purpose |
| **Integration** | External tools and APIs | Limited |
