# What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a software system that can plan tasks, use tools, and carry out multi-step workflows toward a goal—going beyond simple question-and-answer interactions.

## Limitations of Traditional Chatbots

Most AI chatbots today have inherent limitations:

- **Context loss** — Conversations reset with each new session
- **Domain gaps** — Generic models struggle with specialized terminology and workflows
- **Hallucination risk** — Models may generate plausible but incorrect information
- **Single-turn focus** — Optimized for individual prompts rather than complex tasks

## How AI Agents Differ

AI agents address these limitations through several design principles:

### 1. Persistent Context

Agents maintain memory across sessions, building an understanding of your methods, preferences, and past decisions over time.

### 2. Multi-Step Workflows

Rather than responding to single prompts, agents can:
- Decompose complex tasks into steps
- Execute long-running processes
- Integrate with external tools, datasets, or APIs
- Adapt based on intermediate results

### 3. Transparency

Each output is traceable to its source—whether user-provided information or agent reasoning. When uncertain, well-designed agents request clarification rather than guessing.

### 4. Domain Specialization

Agents can be customized with domain-specific knowledge, tools, and workflows relevant to particular fields.

## MorphMind's Implementation

MorphMind provides a platform for creating specialized AI agents without programming. Users describe their workflows in natural language, and the system generates agents tailored to those requirements.

> "In academic labs, building specialized AI agents typically takes a team several months. With MorphMind, any researcher—even without an engineering background—can create complex agents in under an hour, or simple ones in minutes."

The goal is to provide researchers with AI tools that adapt to their work, rather than requiring researchers to adapt to generic tools.
