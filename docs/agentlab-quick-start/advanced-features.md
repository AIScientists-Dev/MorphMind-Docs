# More Features

Beyond the basics, here's what else you can do in AgentLab.

---

## View What Your Agent Has Learned

Your agent builds knowledge over time. Click on the lightbulb icon to open **Agent Knowledge** and see:

- **What Agent Knows** — The core knowledge and setup the agent starts with
- **What Agent Learned From** — Patterns and insights the agent has picked up from your sessions

<img src={require('./screenshots/view-what-agent-learned-over-time.png').default} alt="Agent Knowledge" style={{maxWidth: '500px', width: '100%'}} />

This is how your agent remembers context across sessions—and you can review or edit it anytime.

---

## Manage Agent Files

Access files through the file icon in the top bar. The **Agent Files** panel shows:

- **Generated By Agent** — Files the agent has created (reports, summaries, exports)
- **Uploaded By You** — Documents you've shared with the agent

Download or remove files as needed.

<img src={require('./screenshots/file-management.png').default} alt="Agent Files" style={{maxWidth: '550px', width: '100%'}} />

## Share or Clone Your Agent

Click **Agent Actions** in the top right to:

- **Share Agent** — Give others access to use your agent
- **Copy Agent** — Duplicate the agent for yourself (useful for creating variations)

<img src={require('./screenshots/share-to-other-or-clone-to-myself-agent.png').default} alt="Share or Copy Agent" style={{maxWidth: '250px'}} />
