# Getting Started

> **One thing to remember:** Talk to your agent like you'd talk to a smart colleague. Same tone, same expectations. The AI serves your judgment—you're the expert.

**AgentLab** is where you create, customize, and run AI agents. It's the MorphMind product that lets researchers build workflow-connected agents without engineering a full AI toolchain.

Ready to get started? Here's how.

---

## Step 1: Access AgentLab

Go to [AgentLab](https://agentlab.morphmind.ai) and sign in with your account. You'll land on **My Projects**, where you can see all your agents.

You can also browse **Agent Templates** in the Marketplace to start from pre-built agents.

<img src={require('./screenshots/agent-templates.png').default} alt="Agent Templates" style={{maxWidth: '800px', width: '100%'}} />

## Step 2: Create Your First Agent

Click **+ New Project** to start building.

AgentLab will ask you to describe what problem the agent should solve. Just write in plain language—no coding required.

<img src={require('./screenshots/describe-agent-to-build.png').default} alt="Describe Your Agent" style={{maxWidth: '700px', width: '100%'}} />

For example:
- "Build me an agent that pulls data from PubMed and my lab's internal notes, cross-references findings, and generates a weekly literature digest with citations"
- "Create an investment analyst that fetches real-time market data, runs fundamental and technical analysis, and produces a stock report with risk scores"
- "I need an onboarding assistant that knows our lab protocols, answers new student questions, and remembers what each person has already learned"

---

## Step 3: Use Your Agent

Once created, you'll see the main agent interface with three key areas:

**Left panel — Chat & Results:** This is where you interact with your agent. Ask questions, give tasks, and see the agent's analysis and outputs (tables, scores, insights).

<img src={require('./screenshots/chat-results.png').default} alt="Chat Results" style={{maxWidth: '400px'}} />

**Right panel — Workflow Canvas:** See the agent's workflow as visual steps. Each card is a task the agent can run—like "Fetch Financial Data," "Technical Analysis," or "Generate Stock Report."

<img src={require('./screenshots/canvas-workflow.png').default} alt="Workflow Canvas" style={{maxWidth: '450px'}} />

**Left sidebar — Sessions:** Your conversation history. Each session is saved so you can pick up where you left off.

<img src={require('./screenshots/task-sessions.png').default} alt="Sessions" style={{maxWidth: '200px'}} />

---

## Step 4: Run the Workflow

You have two ways to run your agent:

| Mode | How it works | Best for |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Run All** | Click "Run All" to execute the full workflow automatically | Routine tasks you trust the agent to handle |
| **Step by step** | Click individual workflow cards to run them one at a time | Tasks where you want to review each step |

Start with step-by-step to understand how your agent thinks, then use Run All once you're confident.

## Step 5: Manage Your Account

Click your profile to access **Settings**, where you can manage your account, data connections, and upgrade your plan.
